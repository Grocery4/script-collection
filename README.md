# script-collection
A collection of all my small programs/ scripts I create in my free time whenever I need something to automate out of laziness.

- scriptFormatConverter: Small tool which scans directory in which the file is placed and formats any non-already formatted date to ISO8601 (%Y-%m-%d).
